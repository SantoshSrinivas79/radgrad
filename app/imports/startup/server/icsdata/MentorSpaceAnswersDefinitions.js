    mentor: 'Robert Brewer',
    text: 'Candidates interviewing at Tableau are expected to have broad experience in CS and software engineering. Expect to answer questions on topics like object-oriented design, algorithms, databases, and more by writing code on a whiteboard with no computer in sight. Strong technical skills must be balanced by evidence that you can work well on a team and communicate well with your peers.',

    mentor: 'Patrick Karjala',
    text: 'Grades and classes count; especially classes geared toward the position you\'re reaching for. It is important in the Computer Science field to be able to work collaboratively. Students who have group projects on their GitHub account show me that they are ready for a team development environment. In addition, extracurricular work and internships will make your application stand out among others. Those who have already done programming in a professional internship will be a step ahead!',

    mentor: 'Yuka Nagashima',
    text: 'What I see most often is a lack of preparation. Before the interview, take some time to learn about the organization from their webpage. When students don\'t have a clue about my organization, it reflects very negatively on them. Also, learn to listen well. Really understand what the interviewer is saying and asking, then respond accordingly rather than reciting a canned answer you prepared. Try using similar phrasing and terms they use to show them that you are in tune with there they are coming from.',

    mentor: 'Jeniffer Geis',
    text: 'After the obvious part of learning how to program, it\'s the relationships I formed with instructors and other students that have stood out as having lasting effects on my life and career. Hawaii is a small place where who you know can mean a lot. Almost every employment or contract opportunity I\'ve had has been a result of one of the many relationships I made while getting my degrees.',

    mentor: 'Robert Brewer',
    text: 'Understanding the incredible amount of data that humankind is constantly producing is one of the fundamental challenges facing society. The best way to learn is to pick a topic that interests you, find a public source of data in that area, and start actually looking at the data. What patterns can you see? Start asking questions, and figure out how to answer them from the data. Quick plug: Tableau is great for exploring data graphically, and answering questions about data. It\'s free for students (http://www.tableau.com/academic/students), and Tableau Public (https://public.tableau.com/s/) is a great place to find interesting public data sets and visual analytics based on the data.',

    mentor: 'Dan Leuck',
    text: 'The most obvious thing to do is to actually take data science courses: machine learning, databases, etc. Augment your ICS classes with one of the Coursera or Udacity online courses. But beyond that, it\'s important to learn about one domain in detail so you can apply the algorithms and tweak them to make sure their answers are relevent to the domain. You can\'t just crunch the numbers without some insight into where they are coming from.',
