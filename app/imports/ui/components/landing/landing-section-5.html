      <p>A decent GPA is only one piece of the puzzle for a well-rounded computer science degree experience. RadGrad
        provides a self-assessment tool called "ICE", which stands for Innovation, Competency, and Experience. To be
        competitive in the high tech job market, you want to demonstrate competency (through good grades in CS course
        work), innovation (through participation in research, hackathons, and the like), and real-world experience
        (through participation in internships and other professional experiences.)</p>

      <p>How do you know when you're well-rounded? Just accumulate 100 points in each of the three categories by the
        time you graduate.</p>
