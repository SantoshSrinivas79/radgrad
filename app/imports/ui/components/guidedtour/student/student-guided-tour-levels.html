# Level up!

You will find that once you have created an account in RadGrad, you will have a white badge next to your ICE values in the top header bar.  To show your progress within the RadGrad system, there are **six** levels for you to rank up: white, yellow, green, blue, brown, and black.

The first few levels are rather simple, get good greats and get better gains!  However, you will find that will need more than competency to rank up.  It's a secret, but no white belt is handed a black belt just like that.  Sadly, you don't get a belt as a reward.  Fortunately, you do get a laptop sticker to showcase your awesomeness.
