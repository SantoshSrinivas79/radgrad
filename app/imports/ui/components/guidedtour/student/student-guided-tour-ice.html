          You may have been noticing three colored circles that pop up around each page.  These circles represent the <b>ICE</b> triad.  ICE stands for: innovation, competency, and experience. The goal of ICE is to make students aware that innovation and experience are as important as competency to a high quality undergraduate CS education.  ICE also provides students and advisors with a new means to assess gaps in a student's preparation, and to provide students with a sense for a "good" ICE value through the ranking system.  ICE is measured within your degree planner by the following:
          <br><br>
          <b>Innovation:</b> Based upon opportunities that have a research (or some other innovative) component. <br>
          <b>Competency:</b> Awarded to the students with 10 points for each A (or A+ or A-) received in a CS course and 6 points for each B (or B+ or B-). No points are awarded for grades below B-. <br>
          <b>Experience:</b> Based upon Opportunities that have a professional development component.
