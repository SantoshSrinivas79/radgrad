# Are you experienced?

A well-balanced student learns from experiences inside and outside of school.  RadGrad helps you reach beyond the classroom through **{{publicStats 'opportunitiesTotal'}}** opportunities.  These include:

* Projects: A research or development project, under faculty supervision. For example, you can work with Kim Binsted on the [HI-SEAS](http://hi-seas.org) project.

* Clubs: Many clubs and community organizations provide valuable professional experiences, from [GreyHats](http://www.ics.hawaii.edu/community/community-profile-the-ics-grey-hats/) to [Code For Hawaii](http://www.codeforhawaii.org/).

* Internships: RadGrad helps you find internship opportunities, such as with [Booz Allen](http://www.boozallen.com/careers/find-your-job/graduating-students/strategic-innovation-games).

* Online Learning: For certain technologies, a great place to learn is online. For example, game developers might want to take the [Unity course](https://www.udemy.com/unitycourse/).

* Events: Finally, consider a one or multiple day event, such as [WetWareWednesday](http://htdc.org/wetwarewed/) or the [Hawaii Annual Code Challenge](http://hacc.hawaii.gov/).
