# Now, what did Gerald say again?

RadGrad enhances but does not replace the need for regular meetings with your Advisor.

To help you and your advisor recall the decisions made and actions taken during your meeting, RadGrad provides the Advisor Meeting Log.

Only Advisors can make entries in this log, but both you and your Advisor can see the entries after they have been created.
    
To get the most out of RadGrad, be sure to meet with your advisor once a semester!
