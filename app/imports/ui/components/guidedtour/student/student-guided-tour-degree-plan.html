# Refine your degree plan.

Now that you have picked a few interests, a career goal, and a degree plan, it's time to mix it all together to refine your **degree planner**.  With RadGrad's warning system, knowing what required courses to take are trivial.  It is recommended to evenly distribute courses within a four-year plan.  Unless you are the son of Hercules, no amount of strength will push you through a five ICS course semester.

Say that you have already filled in the proper required courses for your degree plan.  Now what?  Well, take a look at your home page and you will find recommended opportunities based on your interests and career goals.  Add them to your degree planner!  A balanced student is a student who achieves the ICE triad.
