/* Global customizations go here.
   Note that we do not assume that every page will have a menubar at the top.
   If your page has a menubar, you will have to shift the body contents down 60 pixels or so.
   But you cannot globally alter the <body> element style here; you use a <div> and do it on a page-specific basis.
