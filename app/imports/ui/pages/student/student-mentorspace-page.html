                        Why I mentor: I received both a B.S. and M.S. in Computer Science from UH. I've worked in the
                        private
                        sector and done the start-up thing and now work at UH Information and Technology Services.
                        Being from
                        Hawaii my goal was to orient my career so I could stay here and I've learned some lessons
                        along the way.

Expect to answer questions on topics like object-oriented design, algorithms, databases, and more by writing code on a whiteboard with no computer in sight. Strong technical skills must be balanced by evidence that you can work well on a team and communicate well with your peers.

It is important in the Computer Science field to be able to work collaboratively. Students who have group projects on their GitHub account show me that they are ready for a team development environment. In addition, extracurricular work and internships will make your application stand out among others. Those who have already done programming in a professional internship will be a step ahead!

Before the interview, take some time to learn about the organization from their webpage. When students don't have a clue about my organization, it reflects very negatively on them. Also, learn to listen well. Really understand what the interviewer is saying and asking, then respond accordingly rather than reciting a canned answer you prepared. Try using similar phrasing and terms they use to show them that you are in tune with there they are coming from.
