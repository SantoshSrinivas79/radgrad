Expect to answer questions on topics like object-oriented design, algorithms, databases, and more by writing code on a whiteboard with no computer in sight. Strong technical skills must be balanced by evidence that you can work well on a team and communicate well with your peers.

It is important in the Computer Science field to be able to work collaboratively. Students who have group projects on their GitHub account show me that they are ready for a team development environment. In addition, extracurricular work and internships will make your application stand out among others. Those who have already done programming in a professional internship will be a step ahead!

Before the interview, take some time to learn about the organization from their webpage. When students don't have a clue about my organization, it reflects very negatively on them.

The best way to learn is to pick a topic that interests you, find a public source of data in that area, and start actually looking at the data. What patterns can you see?

The best way to learn is to pick a topic that interests you, find a public source of data in that area, and start actually looking at the data. What patterns can you see? Start asking questions, and figure out how to answer them from the data. Quick plug: Tableau is great for exploring data graphically, and answering questions about data. It's free for students (http://www.tableau.com/academic/students), and Tableau Public (https://public.tableau.com/s/) is a great place to find interesting public data sets and visual analytics based on the data.

You can't just crunch the numbers without some insight into where they are coming from.
