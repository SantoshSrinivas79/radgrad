Expect to answer questions on topics like object-oriented design, algorithms, databases, and more by writing code on a whiteboard with no computer in sight. Strong technical skills must be balanced by evidence that you can work well on a team and communicate well with your peers.

It is important in the Computer Science field to be able to work collaboratively. Students who have group projects on their GitHub account show me that they are ready for a team development environment. In addition, extracurricular work and internships will make your application stand out among others. Those who have already done programming in a professional internship will be a step ahead!

              <img class="ui avatar image" src="../images/mentors/nagashima.jpg"> Yuka Nagashima answered: What I see most often is a lack of preparation. Before the interview, take some time to learn about the organization from their webpage. When students don't have a clue about my organization, it reflects very negatively on them. Also, learn to listen well. Really understand what the interviewer is saying and asking, then respond accordingly rather than reciting a canned answer you prepared. Try using similar phrasing and terms they use to show them that you are in tune with there they are coming from.

Hawaii is a small place where who you know can mean a lot. Almost every employment or contract opportunity I've had has been a result of one of the many relationships I made while getting my degrees.
