# RadGrad Goals

## Improve degree planning {#planning}

RadGrad should provide advisors with a better (faster, higher quality) way to help students plan their degree program.

In addition to advisors, students should also find RadGrad helpful for planning their degree program.

To assess progress toward this goal, we can survey students and advisors and ask whether they prefer RadGrad to other mechanisms for degree planning. 

## Provide useful recommendations {#recommendations}

RadGrad should able to guide the student based upon their specific interests and career goals toward an appropriate undergraduate degree experience.

In addition, RadGrad must understand prerequisite requirements and other factors, such as the potential for an overloaded schedule, and warn the student away from problematic situations.

To assess this goal, we can ask students if they find recommendations and warnings useful. We can also log the presence of recommendations and warnings and see if the student reacts to them. For example, when a warning is presented to the student, what percentage of the time does she take an action that removes the warning? When an opportunity is presented to a student, what percentage of the time does she add that opportunity to her degree plan? 

## Improve student engagement {#engagement}

RadGrad should increase student engagement with other students, faculty, and the local high tech community. 

To accomplish this goal, RadGrad should also provide a source of up-to-date, high quality information about courses, faculty research projects, and community events. 

To assess this goal, we can measure the percentage of student degree plans including verified opportunities. We can then survey those students to ask if they believe RadGrad was responsible for them engaging with these outside opportunities. 

## Improve student diversity {#diversity}

We hypothesize that by providing access to the diversity of applications of computer science, we can increase the diversity of students engaged with computer science.

We can measure progress toward this goal using percentage of women graduates,  ethnic demographics, and/or an increase in the diversity of disciplines that our students combine with a computer science degree.

## Improve the degree program {#degree-program}

We hypothesize that satisfying the above requirements will create changes resulting in a better overall computer science degree program: better courses, better opportunities, and better instruction. 

We can measure these goals by surveying students, faculty, and alumni about the degree program.

## Improve post-graduation professional success {#graduation}

RadGrad should lead to graduates who are better prepared and more successful in their professional life after their undergraduate degree program experience.

We can measure progress toward this goal by surveying students on their job opportunities, salary, and admission to graduate programs. We can also compare professional portfolios of our students prior to RadGrad and after introduction of RadGrad.
