# Coding Standards

We aspire to conform to the [AirBnB ES6 Javascript Style Guide](http://airbnb.io/javascript/), and use [ESLint](http://eslint.org/) to enforce compliance as much as possible with these recommendations. 

You can run ESLint configured for AirBnB and Meteor from the command line as follows:

```
app$ meteor npm run lint
```

During active development, however, a much better way to enforce ESLint guidelines is to install ESLint into your editor. 
The [ICS 314 instructions on ESLint in IntelliJ](http://courses.ics.hawaii.edu/ics314f16/morea/coding-standards/experience-install-eslint.html) provides detailed instructions on run ESLint in IntelliJ.
