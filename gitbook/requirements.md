# RadGrad Requirements

## Improve course scheduling {#scheduling}

This requirement implies that Information and Computer Sciences (ICS) advisors will find RadGrad a superior mechanism for communicating with students about schedule planning. 

In addition to ICS advisors, ICS students must also find RadGrad helpful for planning their class schedules.

If students or advisors prefer other mechanisms to RadGrad, then this requirement isn't satisfied for these students or advisors.

## Provide recommendations {#recommendations}

RadGrad must be "smart" and able to guide the student based upon their specific interests and goals toward the most appropriate undergraduate degree experience.

Accomplishing this requires the student to specify their interests and career goals which RadGrad can use to prioritize recommendations.

In addition, RadGrad must understand prerequisite requirements and other factors, such as the potential for an overloaded schedule, and warn the student away from problematic situations.

If RadGrad cannot provide useful recommendations and warnings to a student, then this requirement has not been satisfied for that student.

## Improve student engagement {#engagement}

RadGrad must increase student engagement with other students, faculty, and the local high tech community. 

RadGrad must provide a source of up-to-date, high quality information about not only about courses but also about faculty research projects and community events. 

If students limit their degree program activities to coursework performed in isolation, then this requirement has not been satisfied for that student.

## Improve student diversity {#diversity}

Student diversity can be measured by an increased percentage of women graduates, an increase in ethnic diversity, and/or an increase in the diversity of disciplines that our students combine with a computer science degree.

STAR data can be used to assess improvements in diversity.

## Improve graduate success {#graduation}

RadGrad must lead to students who graduate with better preparation and who are more successful in their professional life after their undergraduate degree program experience.

This can be measured via more job opportunities, better job opportunities, salary, admission to graduate programs. We can also compare professional portfolios prior to RadGrad and after introduction of RadGrad.
