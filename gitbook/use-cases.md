# Use Cases

The goal of this section is to provide guidance for initial development by describing how the system will be used in common contexts.

### Advisor meeting: first contact, no ICS background

*Context:* An ICS advisor is meeting with a student for the first time. The student has not yet taken any ICS courses and wants to learn about the major.
 
*Goal:* RadGrad helps the advisor learn about the student's background and interests in order to help them assess their suitability for an ICS degree.  RadGrad also helps the student learn more about ICS.

*Steps:*

1. Advisor logs into RadGrad using their UH account and password, authorizes login for student by providing student ID, UH username, first and last name. 
2. RadGrad sends an email to the student welcoming them to the system and providing them with the URL to the system and brief instructions.
2. Advisor gets Student ID number, downloads STAR data as CSV, uploads it into student's RadGrad account.
3. Advisor looks at student's course history in RadGrad, asks about the student's interests in computer science and possible career goals, and adds those to the system. 
4. Advisor picks a degree plan template from a selection offered by RadGrad based upon student interests and current courses.  RadGrad fills out the student's degree plan to show how (and when) they might graduate with an ICS degree.
5. Advisor makes notes about the meeting in RadGrad, which is saved and available to the student by logging into the system.
6. Advisor suggests that student explore the ICS degree further using RadGrad on their own time, and to come back for more consultation if they have questions.

### Student login, first time

*Context:* A student has met with an ICS advisor who has set up their RadGrad account. The student has received an email with login instructions. They now want to learn more about the ICS major.

*Goal:* RadGrad helps the student learn more about computer science in general and the ICS degree program in particular, in order to decide whether or not to pursue the degree program.

*Steps:* 

1. Student clicks on URL in email message from RadGrad to get to system.
2. Student logs in using their UH account and password.
3. Student goes to home page.  From the home page, the student can:
   * Browse Interests and learn more about them.
   * Browse Career Goals and learn more about them.
   * Browse Courses and learn more about them (review site, student reviews).
   * Watch short videos by ICS community members discussing the program and discipline.
   * Learn about alternatives to ICS degree programs (ITM, Computer Engineering, Communications, Graphic Arts, ACM). Also community college programs in security, networking, etc.?
4. RadGrad recommends that the student become engaged with the UH student community by attending the next meeting of ACM Manoa.

From this session, the student acquires a better understanding of the ICS degree program and the discipline and makes a decision as to whether or not to enroll in ICS 111 and ICS 141.  They might also decide to pursue a different discipline.
 
### Advisor meeting: during or after ICS 111.

*Context:* A student has made an initial commitment to an ICS degree by enrolling in ICS 111, and meets with an ICS Advisor to discuss next steps.

*Goal:* The student learns about how to use RadGrad to integrate extracurricular activities and measure progress through ICE Points and Levels.

*Steps:*

1. The advisor logs into RadGrad using their UH account and password and brings up the student's account.
2. If the student's STAR data is out of date, the advisor uploads current STAR data.
2. The advisor introduces the student to RadGrad's recommendations, warnings, opportunities, ICE points, and Levels. 
3. The advisor gives the student a Level 1 laptop sticker because they enrolled in ICS 111.
4. The advisor and student discuss what the student needs to do to get to Level 2.
5. The advisor and student review and make adjustments to interests and career goals.

The student now has a better understanding of how to proceed through the ICS degree program, not only by taking courses, but also by taking on extracurricular activities (opportunities).
