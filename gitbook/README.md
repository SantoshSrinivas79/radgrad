# Why RadGrad?

The discipline of computer science evolves faster than any other. "Data science" became an important area of academic study in just a few years, and now "deep learning" is emerging as an important area of study. New disruptive technologies appear on a regular basis, from [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) to [MapReduce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MapReduce) to [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/). 

Even the teaching of computer science is subject to frequent disruption. The first course taught as a "Massively Online Open Course" (MOOC) was Artificial Intelligence. A recent trend is the "coding bootcamp", a short, intensive, high-cost, non-university traineeship to help non-programmers quickly develop simple web application development skills. For some, bootcamps call into the question the return-on-investment of a four year university degree in computer science. 

This rate of change means the discipline of computer science can evolve significantly from the time a student enters university to the time they graduate. The goal of RadGrad is to help academic computer science degree programs, and the students in them, evolve their educational processes as fast as the discipline is itself evolving.
