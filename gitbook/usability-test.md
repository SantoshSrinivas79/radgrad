# Spring 2017 Usability Test

The goals of Spring 2017 RadGrad Usability Test are to: identify problems faced by students and advisors when using the system; collect data useful for improving the system; and determine overall satisfaction with the current design of RadGrad by these two user roles. 

This usability test will not assess users in the faculty or mentor roles.

## Test Plan: Students

**Context**: We will test the system with approximately six students. Two students will be fresh out of ICS 111, two will be around the 311 level, and two will graduate this Spring.  

To recruit these students, Philip will send email to student mailing lists offering $20 to those who will attend a 30 minute session and pointing them to a form to fill out if they want to be considered as a subject. The form will ask them:
 
 * what ICS courses they've completed (from a multiple selection list), 
 * any extracurricular computer science activities they've participated in, 
 * what interests they have (from a multiple selection list), 
 * what career goals they are considering (from a multiple selection list), 
 * what times they can be available (from a multiple selection list), and 
 * their UH account name.

Prior to the session, we will create an account for them in RadGrad, input their STAR data, and add opportunities corresponding to their extracurricular activities.  

The goal of the session is to:

  * Gather evidence as to whether they feel RadGrad would improve their engagement with the ICS degree program.
  
  * Assess if the user interface is self-explanatory, and determine what parts are non-intuitive or difficult to use.

  * Discover missing features that should be implemented.

  * Discover better ways of implementing current features.
  
Since we will not publish this data, there is no need for an IRB release form. 
  
**Procedure**: Here is the structure of the evaluation session:

The student arrives at POST 307 at the scheduled time.  The student will use Philip's laptop to access Radgrad. The laptop is connected to the projector so that all observers can easily watch what takes place.  The student will sign a release form indicating the goals of the study and that we will be using ScreenFlow to create a recording of the entire session.  

The evaluator (or another observer) will be also logged into RadGrad as an admin. The admin will be responsible for updating the student's degree plan if necessary.

1. The student watches a short 2-3 minute video called "Introduction to RadGrad for Students". This video explains the goals of RadGrad in general, the specific features it provides for students, and an overview of the user interface.

1. The evaluator starts up ScreenFlow, then logs the student into their RadGrad account.

2. The evaluator asks the student to look around the system for a couple of minutes and verbalize any thoughts that  occur to them as they review the pages and features. 

3. After the student has finished looking around, the evaluator directs them to go to the Degree Planner page. The evaluator asks them if the degree plan reflects their current situation. If there are additional courses or opportunities, the admin will add them to the student's degree plan and set them as verified.

2. Once the degree plan appears accurate to the student, the evaluator gives them with a laptop sticker associated with their level.

4. The evaluator asks the student to work on their degree plan for a couple of minutes, adding courses and opportunities in order to complete their degree requirements and try to get to ICE of 100/100/100. (We want to assess the ease of use of the degree planner, and whether ICE makes sense.)

6. The evaluator asks the student to try to figure out which of the courses they are taking next semester will be the hardest, or easiest, or "best". (This will hopefully lead them to look at course reviews.)

7. The evaluator asks the student to use RadGrad to find out what they need to work on now if they were to want to prepare to get a job in Silicon Valley. (This will hopefully lead them to look at the Mentorspace area and compare/contrast the recommendations with their own current level of preparation.)
 
8. The simulated advising session ends here, and to conclude the evaluation, we ask the student about whether they feel RadGrad will improve their engagement with the ICS Degree Program; and their insights into what could be added or improved about RadGrad from the student perspective. Finally, would they use RadGrad?

**Evaluation**: Here are some of the outcomes we hope to achieve:

* What are the critical usability errors in the system? What problems did students experience while navigating the system? What information did they overlook or never access?

* How well was RadGrad able to represent their degree experience? Are there things we have overlooked?

* How well is ICE designed? Did the point system seem to incentivize appropriate degree planning?

* How well are the Levels designed? Did the student get a sticker appropriate to their preparation?
 
* Was the system easy to understand? Did the students have any conceptual difficulties?

* Would the students use RadGrad?

### Test Plan: Advisors

**Context**: We will have two meetings: one with Gerald and one with Man Chon.  The goals of these evaluation sessions are to:

  * Gather evidence as to whether RadGrad will provide a faster (i.e. less time needed with students) and more effective (i.e. students get a better understanding of the ICS degree program) than the current approach. 

  * Discover missing features that should be implemented prior to initial release.

  * Discover better ways of implementing current features.
  
The advisor evaluation will take place after all student evaluations are done. 
   
**Procedure**: Here is the structure of the evaluation session:

First, the advisor watches a short 2-3 minute video called "Introduction to RadGrad for Advisors". This video explains the goals of RadGrad in general, the specific features it provides for advisors, and an overview of the user interface.

Now a "simulated advising session" begins. We will use screenflow to create a recording of the session, capturing what happens on the screen as well as what is spoken. 

Here is the sequence of activities:

1. One of the RadGrad developers will roleplay the part of a beginning ICS student and say they would like to learn more about the ICS degree program.  

2. The advisor logs to RadGrad with their ID (glau or mckuok). This takes them to the advisor home page.  The advisor asks the student for their student ID. We provide an ID that retrieves a beginning student's STAR data. 

3. The advisor asks the student about their interests, career goals, and and desired degree. Those are input into the system, and then the advisor runs the "Generate Template" command to fill out the student's degree plan.  The plan includes both courses and opportunities and results in a projected ICE score of 100/100/100.  All courses have a projected grade of either B or A; there should be the minimum number of A's required to get to 100.   

4. The student asks some questions: for example, what is ICS 332?  What is this internship opportunity? The idea here is to have the advisor use the interface to show the student more things about the system. 

5. The student requests some changes to the degree plan: different courses, different opportunities. The advisor makes these changes.

5. The advisor fills out an entry for the "Advisor Log". This provides a brief summary of the meeting along with whatever suggestions the advisor has for the student. 

The simulated advising session ends here, and to conclude the evaluation, we ask the advisor about whether they feel RadGrad will make advising faster and/or more effective; and their insights into what could be added or improved about RadGrad for the purpose of student advising.

**Evaluation**: Here are some of the outcomes we hope to achieve:

* What are usability problems faced by advisors when using the current version of the system? How can they be addressed?

* Do advisors find RadGrad preferable to their current approach to ICS student advising? If not, why not? What can we do about that?
