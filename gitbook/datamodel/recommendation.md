# Recommendations and warnings

Recommendations and warnings help students understand how to change their current behavior and choices for the better. Recommendations are basically "positive" (they suggest new things to do), while warnings are basically "negative" (they identify current plans that have some risk of a poor outcome). 

Based upon their current degree plan, career goals, and interests, recommendations and warnings provide actions tailored to the student.  This can include:

* relevant courses not already present in their degree plan.

* relevant opportunities not already present in their degree plan.

* an estimate of the maximum number of work hours possible without overcommitting given the courses and activities planned for each semester.   

* predicted impact of their GPA (if low).
