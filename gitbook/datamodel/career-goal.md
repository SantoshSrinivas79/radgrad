# Career Goal

Career goals enable RadGrad to identify appropriate combinations of curricular and extracurricular activities to prepare a student for their professional life after graduation.  Here are some sample career goals:
 
#### Security

A *Security* career goal helps students become well prepared for post-graduate work in cybersecurity. It might require:

* Satisfying the [security science degree focus](http://www.ics.hawaii.edu/academics/undergraduate-degree-programs/bs-ics/): (including ICS 355, 423, 455).
* Participation in [ICS Grey Hats](http://www.ics.hawaii.edu/community/community-profile-the-ics-grey-hats/) for at least two semesters.
* Participation in at least one Security contest, such as the [National Cyber League](http://www.nationalcyberleague.org/index.shtml).

#### Ph.D. Prep 
 
A *Ph.D. Prep* career goal helps students prepare for admission to a Ph.D. program. It might require:

* Taking at least one graduate level (6xx) course.
* Attending at least one conference.
* Publishing at least one workshop paper as primary author.
* Working with a faculty member on their research project.
* Writing a senior honors thesis and [graduating with honors](http://manoa.hawaii.edu/undergrad/honors/graduating-with-honors/).

#### Silicon Valley Tech 

A *Silicon Valley Tech* career goal might satisfy the requirements from [Google's Technical Development Guide](https://www.google.com/about/careers/students/guide-to-technical-development.html). It might require:

* Introduction to CS (ICS 111 or ICS 222)
* One OO language (C++, Java, Python) (ICS 111, 211)
* One other language (Javascript, Ruby, PHP, etc.) (ICS 212, 313, 314)
* Testing (ICS 314, 414)
* Discrete Math (ICS 141, 241)
* Algorithms (ICS 311)
* Operating systems (ICS 332)
* UX design (ICS 314, 414)
* AI (ICS 361)
* Compilers (ICS 611)
* Cryptography (ICS 423)
* Parallel programming (ICS 432)
* Outside projects (ICS 499 or non-curricular project)
* Open source contributions ([Google Summer of Code](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/))
* Team development (ICS 314, 414)
* Coding competitions ([ACM ICPC](https://icpc.baylor.edu/))
* Teach others (ICS 390 or some other teaching activity)
* Software engineering internship (Summer Internship with local company)

While this career goal is relatively demanding, it is intended to make our graduates competitive with the many others seeking employment in Silicon Valley.

## Workflow

Note that career goals are not mutually exclusive: if a student wants to go to graduate school in cybersecurity, they could satisfy both the Ph.D. Prep and Security career goals. 

The directory can be filtered by students specifying an interest in a particular degree goal, which can aid in forming communities of interest.
